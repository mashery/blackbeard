# Code Standards

Make sure your code meets the following code standards:

- Camel case for JavaScript variables.
- [Object-Oriented CSS](http://www.slideshare.net/stubbornella/object-oriented-css) for CSS selectors.
- Favor readable code over brevity. The build process will reduce size, so opt for readability. (ex. `var navigation` is better than `var n`)
- Order CSS properties alphabetically.
- Hard tabs.
